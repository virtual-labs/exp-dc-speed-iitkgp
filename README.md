### About the Experiment 
**System description**

<b>DC Motors</b>

The dc machine can operate both as a generator and as a motor. This is illustrated in Fig.below.When it operates as a generator, the input to the machine is mechanical power,and the output is electrical power. A prime mover rotates the armature of the dc machine, and dc power is generated in the machine. The prime mover can be a gas turbine,a diesel engine, or an electrical motor. When the dc machine operates as a motor, the input to the machine is electricalpower, and the output is mechanical power.If the armature is connected to a dc supply, the motor will develop mechanical torque and power. In fact, the dc machine is used more as a motor than as a generator.

DC motors can provide a wide range of accurate speed and torque control.In both modes of operation (generator and motor) the armature winding rotates in the magnetic field and carries current.
